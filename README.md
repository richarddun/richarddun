# Hi, I’m Richard 👋

Welcome to my digital workshop.

I enjoy building useful tools, automating repetitive tasks, and experimenting with Python.  
Over the years I've dabbled in everything from game development to terminal utilities, and more recently, Agentic AI projects with pydantic-ai.

### 🧰 Pinned Projects
- 💸 **Budget Buddy** - an Agentic interface to YNAB for AI assisted budget assistance, including read/write operations to a budget.
- ⚕️ **Llogos** - a novel LLM assisted personal web page customizer (prototype, wip)
- 🤖 **Entourage** - an early integration prototype with GPT3.5 (build with Kivy as standalone application)
- 🐉 **Alpha-Dragon** – a vintage experiment in Python turn based strategy game development in the terminal using ncurses
- 📦 **zipper** – an early prototype 2D platform game built on Kivy
- 🧪 **util** – a grab-bag of small utilities and terminal scripts  

I’m always tinkering.
